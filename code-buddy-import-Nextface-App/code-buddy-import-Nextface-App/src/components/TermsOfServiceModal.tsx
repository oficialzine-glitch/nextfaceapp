                  Welcome to NextFace AI! NextFace AI (the "App") is provided by BluePeak Global, LLC, a Wyoming, USA limited liability company ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). By downloading or using NextFace AI, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please do not use the App. These Terms form a binding agreement between you and the Company regarding your use of NextFace AI. We may update these Terms from time to time by posting the revised Terms in the App or our website and updating the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of NextFace AI after changes means you accept the revised Terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Age Requirement:</strong> You must be at least 16 years old to use NextFace AI. We do not permit use by individuals under 16. If you are 16 or 17, you should use NextFace AI only with the consent and supervision of a parent or guardian. By using the App, you represent that you meet this age requirement. If we discover anyone under 16 is using the App, we will terminate the account and delete any associated data.

                <p>
                  NextFace AI provides an AI-powered facial analysis service. When you upload a photo of your face, the App uses artificial intelligence (including OpenAI's technology) to generate an attractiveness score and aesthetic feedback. You may receive ratings on various facial features and suggestions for possible improvements. The service is intended for informational and entertainment purposes only – it is not a medical or professional advice tool. The features and content of the App may evolve over time, and we reserve the right to modify or discontinue certain features at our discretion.

                <p>
                  To use NextFace AI, you must sign in with a Google account via Google Sign-In. We will collect your Google account email address to create and authenticate your user account. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Google account credentials; any activity on NextFace AI through your Google account is your responsibility. Do not share your login credentials with others. If you suspect unauthorized access to your account, please notify us immediately.

                  NextFace AI is an evolving product. We may add, modify, or remove features or content from the App at any time. We are not liable to you or any third party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuation of the App or any part of it. We will try to give advance notice of major changes (for example, by posting in-app notifications), but this may not always be possible.

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-white font-semibold text-lg mb-3">12. Changes to Terms</h3>
                <p>
                  We may update these Terms of Service periodically. If we make material changes, we will notify users by posting the updated Terms in the App (or through other communication) at least 30 days before the changes take effect, when feasible. The "Last Updated" date at the top will always indicate the latest revision. Please review the Terms regularly. By continuing to use NextFace AI after updated Terms are effective, you agree to the changes. If you do not agree to a change, you should stop using the App and, if desired, delete your account.

                <p className="mb-3">
                  These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Wyoming, without regard to its conflict of law principles. We are based in Wyoming, and that is our "home" jurisdiction. If you have any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to NextFace AI or these Terms, you agree to first contact us to attempt an informal resolution. If we cannot resolve the issue informally, any legal action shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in Wyoming (unless otherwise required by applicable consumer protection laws). You agree to the personal jurisdiction of those courts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>For EU Users:</strong> If you are using NextFace AI as a consumer in the European Union, you may have certain mandatory rights under your local consumer protection laws. Nothing in these Terms affects your rights to benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you reside, to the extent those apply (this is consistent with standard terms for apps available globally).

                <p className="mb-3">
                  <strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable from the Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. The rest of the Terms will remain in full effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>No Waiver:</strong> If we do not enforce a provision of these Terms on any particular occasion, it does not mean we waive our right to enforce it later. Similarly, any waiver of compliance with these Terms in a particular situation is not a waiver for the future or for any other provision.
